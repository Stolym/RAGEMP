Usage: ftinitupload clientftfid={clientFileTransferID} name={filePath}
       cid={channelID} cpw={channelPassword} size={fileSize} overwrite={1|0}
       resume={1|0} [proto=0-1]

Permissions:
  i_ft_file_upload_power
  i_ft_needed_file_ upload _power
  i_ft_quota_mb_upload_per_client

Description:
  Initializes a file transfer upload. clientftfid is an arbitrary ID to
  identify the file transfer on client-side. On success, the server generates a
  new ftkey which is required to start uploading the file through TeamSpeak 3's
  file transfer interface. Since version 3.0.13 there is an optional proto
  parameter. The client can request a protocol version with it. Currently only
  0 and 1 are supported which only differ in the way they handle some timings.
  The server will reply which protocol version it will support. The server will
  reply with an ip parameter if it determines the filetransfer subsystem is not
  reachable by the ip that is currently being used for the query connection.

Example:
  ftinitupload clientftfid=1 name=\/image.iso cid=5 cpw= size=673460224 overwrite=1 resume=0
  clientftfid=1 serverftfid=6 ftkey=itRNdsIOvcBiBg\/Xj4Ge51ZSrsShHuid port=30033 seekpos=0 proto=0
  error id=0 msg=ok
